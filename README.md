File description:

rrn_DBv2.fasta.gz, is a compressed file containing the updated sequence database of rrn operons used for read mapping. A total of 22,580 sequences are compiled into this multifasta file.

rrn_DBv2.tax, is a tab-delimited text file containing the annotation of every single rrn operon in the database. Column information = "operon id", "GenBank identifier" (not available for assembled operONTs), "operon length (bp)", "bacterial phylum", "bacterial order", "bacterial family", "bacterial genus", "bacterial species". 

Annotation was manually curated against the NCBI taxonomy database.

"operONT" labeled entries correspond to sequences assembled using MinION/R9.5 data.
