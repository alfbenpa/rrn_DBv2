# rrn_DBv2
Updated rrn database (version 2.0)

This repository contains information related with the publication entitled: Benítez-Páez A et al. Strand-wise and bait-assisted assembly of nearly-full rrn operons using nanopore sequencing data and its application to follow faecal microbiota transplantation and species engraftment. 2019.

File description:

rrn_DBv2.fasta.bz2, is a compressed file containing the updated sequence database of rrn operons used for read mapping.

rrn_DBv2.tax, is a tab-delimited text file containing the annotation of every single rrn operon in the database. Column information = operon id, GenBank identifier (not available for assembled operONTs), operon length (bp), bacterial phylum, bacterial order, bacterial family, bacterial genus, bacterial species.

Different levels of annotation were manually curated against the NCBI taxonomy database.
